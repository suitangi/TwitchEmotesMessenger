# Emotes For Messenger ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suitangi/TwitchEmotesMessenger/master/chrome-extension/icons/icon48.png)
This Extension allows Twitch, BTTV and custom Emotes to show up for Facebook's Messenger on [messenger.com](messenger.com).

**Get the extension here:**

## How to Use:

## Emote List
Not every emote is supported (especially since many are channel-specific/have many duplicate forms).
The list of supported emotes can be found [here](https://suitangi.github.io/TwitchEmotesMessenger/support/emotes-list).

## Other Information
**This is a third party extension and is not affiliated with Facebook Messenger or Twitch. All emotes and images belong to their respective owners.**

The project is open-sourced, you can check it out [here](https://suitangi.github.io/TwitchEmotesMessenger/). I don’t collect any user data nor will I in the future.
Please report bugs to suitangi778@gmail.com.
