# Twitch Emotes For Messenger ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suitangi/TwitchEmotesMessenger/master/chrome-extension/icons/icon48.png)
This Extension allows Twitch and BTTV Emotes to show up for Facebook's Messenger on [messenger.com](messenger.com).

**Get the extension here:**

## How to Use:
1. Install the extension
2. Go to [messenger.com](messenger.com) or refresh the page if you are already there.
3. The emote texts in messages you send and receive should show up as emotes like on Twitch!

- Emote replacement: Replaces text in messages as emotes (images).
- Hover: Hover over emote for the text OR hover over the text for emote (if emote replacement is off).
*Both emote replacement and hover are on by default*

## Emote List
Not every emote is support (especially since many are channel-specific/have many duplicate forms).
The list of supported emotes can be found [here](https://suitangi.github.io/TwitchEmotesMessenger/support/emotes-list).

## Other Information
**This is a third party extension and is not affiliated with Facebook Messenger or Twitch. All emotes and images belong to their respective owners.**

The project is open-sourced, you can check it out [here](https://suitangi.github.io/TwitchEmotesMessenger/). I don’t collect any user data nor will I in the future.
